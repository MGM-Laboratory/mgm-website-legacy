# CI/CD

Every push to `main` on `github.com/MGM-Laboratory/mgm-website` triggers CI, security scanning, e2e, the Docker build/publish/sign pipeline, and Railway auto-deploy. Every PR additionally gets all of that plus SonarCloud, three Harness checks, and a status comment. `main` is protected: PRs need every required check green to merge; repo admins can bypass for direct pushes.

Renovate (not Dependabot — see the commit that swapped them) handles npm/Docker/GitHub Actions version updates; GitHub's native Dependabot security alerts stay on regardless.

### Fork-PR safety model

`/preview`'s `build` job is the only one that ever executes a PR's own code, and it holds zero secrets. Environment provisioning, image push, and data seeding are separate jobs that only ever touch artifacts that job produced — never the PR source directly. `preview-teardown.yml` and `harness.yml` use `pull_request_target` (not `pull_request`) because they need secrets but never run PR code at all — they only read the event payload (PR number, head SHA) and call an API.

### Verification commands

```bash
gh run list -R MGM-Laboratory/mgm-website
gh run watch -R MGM-Laboratory/mgm-website <id>
gh workflow run ci.yaml -R MGM-Laboratory/mgm-website --ref main
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp '.*' --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com docker.io/labmgm/website-api:latest
```

## SonarCloud

Wired via SonarCloud's own GitHub App (Automatic Analysis), project `MGM-Laboratory_mgm-website2` — posts its own "SonarCloud Code Analysis" check on every push/PR with no workflow file needed.

## Harness

A second CI platform, independent of GitHub Actions:

1. **`harness-ci`** — build/lint/typecheck/test as a cross-platform second opinion.
2. **`harness-security`** — Semgrep SAST (distinct coverage from CodeQL).
3. **`harness-supply-chain`** — syft SBOM + a grype critical-CVE policy gate (distinct from the cosign/attest-sbom path).

Account `zpdJUsWiSYeXsnoCY8whvg`, org `default`, project `default_project`. Pipeline YAML lives in `.harness/`. There's deliberately no Harness-side GitHub connector or webhook trigger — the repo is public, so each pipeline just `git clone`s it directly, and `harness.yml` (GitHub Actions side) triggers executions via the Harness API and posts results back as commit statuses. This also sidesteps a connector-creation schema issue on this account that had no discoverable fix.

**Harness Cloud needs a credit card on file to run anything** ("To use Harness Cloud, you must provide a credit card to validate your account") — a one-time step in Harness account settings. Until then, all three checks fail at the billing gate before any real work runs.

## Preview environments (`/preview`)

Commenting `/preview` on a PR (maintainers/collaborators only) deploys a throwaway copy of the full stack:

1. **provision** (secrets, no PR code) — forks a `preview-pr-<n>` Railway environment from `production` (`environmentCreate` with `sourceEnvironmentId`, which clones service/database topology without copying any data), generates api/web domains, creates a dedicated bucket, overrides the vars that came over as literal values rather than references (bucket credentials, admin passphrase).
2. **build** (no secrets, runs the PR's own code) — builds both Docker images from the PR head.
3. **push-and-deploy** (secrets) — pushes the images Job 2 built to Docker Hub, points the preview environment's services at them (scoped to that environment only — verified this never affects production), then watches both deployments strictly: checked every minute, up to 3 automatic retries with the crash's log excerpt posted to the PR on each one, a one-time CODEOWNERS-mention comment if it's still not up after 10 minutes (without giving up), and a hard 1 hour ceiling. A single upserted status comment tracks the live state throughout.
4. **seed-and-announce** (secrets) — seeds published content into the preview by reading production's own public `/api/cms/*` endpoints (drafts and admin-only fields are already filtered server-side there — no database credential is used for either environment) and POSTing it to the preview api's `/bootstrap` endpoints, copies only the bucket objects actually referenced, mints a fresh superadmin via the preview api, comments the links + a seeded-content table + credentials on the PR.

`CmsAdmin` (password hashes) and `CmsJobApplication` (applicant PII/CVs) have no public endpoint and are never read. Torn down automatically on PR close (or on `/merge`), with a daily reaper as a backstop.

**Needs a credit card equivalent for Railway**: this is real infrastructure spend per run — it's deliberately not triggered automatically, only by an explicit `/preview` comment from a maintainer or CODEOWNERS reviewer, who can also re-run it any time.

## Merging (`/merge`)

Commenting `/merge` on a PR (maintainers/CODEOWNERS only) runs `merge.yml`, entirely API-driven — no PR code is ever checked out:

1. Checks every check-run and commit status against the PR's head commit, plus GitHub's own `mergeable` flag. Anything failing, still running, or a merge conflict → replies with what's blocking it and stops. Nothing is changed.
2. If everything's green: posts one combined comment thanking the contributor by name (with a small stats table and the check results), then the LGTM GIF.
3. Merges with a merge commit (not squash — this repo keeps granular history, see `docs/repo-history.md`).
4. Deletes the head branch only if it's genuinely safe: same repo (not a fork), not the default branch, and no other open PR still points at it.
5. Tears down that PR's `preview-pr-<n>` Railway environment if one exists — the lookup is asserted against the production environment id first, so it can never touch the real deployment.
6. Watches the merge commit's own checks and production's post-merge deployment (Railway's GitHub integration deploys independently of this workflow — the signal watched is the production service instances' `latestDeployment` actually changing, not just going back to `SUCCESS`) for up to 10 minutes, then posts a final success comment or a CODEOWNERS-mention if anything came back unhealthy.

## Railway

- **Project:** `mgm-company-profile` — id `810d3a40-d9d2-410c-b117-289d2aff095f` (workspace "Shirasaka Ren")
- **Environment:** `production` — id `42acf786-e8f4-41f8-8d4f-715bee1655f8`
- **Services:**
  - `web` (id `4969778e-0bff-4200-9472-6b5a13f037da`) — source: `MGM-Laboratory/mgm-website`, branch `main`, deploy on push; public domain `web-production-589d3f.up.railway.app` (port 3000)
  - `api` (id `b401b859-90cb-44cf-9787-054cc14290fd`) — same repo/branch, deploy on push
  - `Postgres` + `Redis` (managed) + `mgm-storage` S3-compatible bucket
- Deployments are **watch-path driven**: a push with no changes to a service's files skips it; normal pushes deploy both.

CLI checks (repo is linked to this project):

```bash
railway status --json                 # linked project context
railway deployment list --json        # newest-first; verify SUCCESS
railway logs --service web --lines 100
railway redeploy --service web --from-source --yes   # force pull latest commit
```

The Railway MCP tools are also available in agent sessions (`list-projects`, `describe-environment`, `list-deployments`, `get-logs`, …). Note: the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret used by the preview pipeline is a **project token** (scoped to `mgm-company-profile`, not the full account) — it can create/delete environments and services within this project via the public GraphQL API, but account-level queries like `me` fail for it by design.

## Governance

`main` requires a PR + every required status check to merge; repo admins can bypass (Settings → Rules → Rulesets). External contributors go through the full PR flow described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; the owner/agent workflow of committing and pushing directly to `main` for routine work is unaffected.

## Local

`docker compose up` runs Postgres 17 + api (4000) + web (3000) with vars from `.env` / `.env.example`. `DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` in `.env.example` is the compose image namespace — CI uses repo-level GitHub vars instead.

## Historical: the workflow-rename incident (2026-09-12)

After the repo migration, push-triggered runs silently stopped firing on the fresh repo while `workflow_dispatch` kept working (everything read as enabled — the first-push workflow registration was stale). Renaming `ci.yml` → `ci.yaml` forced a fresh registration and restored push triggers instantly. If push-triggered Actions ever silently stop on a repo while dispatch works, try forcing re-registration (rename the workflow file) before suspecting anything deeper.
