# Navigation Menu System

The site's only navigation is the full-screen right-side menu (`nav/nav-menu.tsx`), derived from the React Bits `StaggeredMenu` component and modeled on the menu at `https://kaizin.framer.website` (studied, then rebuilt on the MGM design system — not copied verbatim). The old center navbar was removed entirely; `site-header.tsx` is LogoMark + ID/EN + ThemeToggle + hamburger.

## Behavior spec

**Open**: hamburger click → overlay dims/blurs the page, four brand-color layers stagger across the screen in sequence, the panel slides in from the right, nav items cascade in, and the MGM ShardLogo **assembles itself** on the empty left side (same shard animation as the hero, `back.out(1.9)`, delayed ~0.3× the panel's duration; **no** post-assembly stomp/pulse — that was removed on purpose). Scroll is locked while open.

**Close**: reverse — logo fades out (`power2.in`), layers sweep back, panel exits. Escape, backdrop click, and route change all close. Focus returns to the toggle.

**A11y**: `inert={!open}` + `aria-hidden={!open}` on the panel, `aria-expanded` on the toggle, focus moves into the panel on open and back on close. Reduced motion: durations collapse to 0 so everything is instant but reachable (decorative-only loops like the social wiggle are skipped).

**Theme-aware**: panel background is `--surface-muted` (light in light mode, dark in dark mode); text `--foreground`. This was an explicit user requirement — test both themes.

**Reload flash**: a previous bug made the menu flash open for a split second on reload (SSR HTML rendered it visible). Closed-state defaults are now static opacity/visibility classes (`invisible opacity-0`), with GSAP owning transforms exclusively — see gotchas #1 and #5 in `docs/animation-system.md`.

## Item animations

Each row: number + label + trailing icon (ArrowUpRight for links, ChevronDown for dropdowns — the chevron moves **in sync with the text**, 14px, same duration/ease). On hover: an `ItemFill` sweep (accent-colored) scales across, label slides 14px and takes the item's brand color, number scales `back.out(2)` and colors, arrow fades/slides in. Hover timelines use `.fromTo()` baselines (`immediateRender: !reduced`) per gotcha #3.

## Dropdowns (bento cards, title-only — descriptions were removed by request)

- **Focus** — 2×2 flip cards (`[perspective:900px]` outer, preserve-3d inner, back pre-rotated 180°): front = brand-color fill + oversized `CompetencyMotifShape` corner decoration (`stroke rgba(255,255,255,0.32)`) + title; hover flips to back = smaller watermark motif + title + "Explore" pill. Mirrors the homepage competency cards' motifs/colors.
- **Our Work** — deliberately _different_ mechanic: front = title + `FlairShape` pattern-tile watermark (`opacity-20`, brand tone); hover = link lifts `y:-4` + shadow AND an accent panel slides up from the bottom (`gsap.set(panel,{yPercent:100})` on mount — required because it mounts inside a height-0 clip; gotcha #6) showing title + "View" pill, while the watermark pops in (`scale 0.85 rotate -6 → identity`, `back.out(1.6)`). No z-10 on the front title (gotcha #7).

## Bottom block

- **"Let's Talk"** — `EmailReveal` with `hi@labmgm.org` (from `data/nav.ts`; do not hardcode). Hover opens an upward dropdown (`bottom-full`, since it sits at the panel bottom): "Copy email" (clipboard write → Check icon + "Copied!" for ~1.8s) and "Open in Mail app" (`mailto:`). 150ms delayed close on mouseleave, cancelled on re-enter.
- **Malang (ID) WIB clock** — hydration-safe (`"--:--"` SSR placeholder, `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: "Asia/Jakarta"` in effect, 30s updates).
- **Socials** — icon-only (Instagram, X, YouTube, LinkedIn, Discord; placeholder hrefs), each with its own GSAP wiggle on hover (rotate -14 → rotate 14 + scale 1.25 + its brand accent color → settle, `back.out(3)`). Icons adapt to theme via `currentColor`.
- **Legal row** — real links to `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-services`.

## Sizing (the no-scroll guarantee)

**Hard requirement from the owner: the menu must never scroll — all content fits in one view at any aspect ratio, scaling fluidly.** Implementation: a single font-size anchor on the `<nav>` — `text-[clamp(1rem,2.7dvh,1.75rem)]` — and **everything else sized in `em` off it** (item text, gaps `0.7em`, paddings, icon sizes). Bento tiles: height `clamp(1.9rem,5.2dvh,3rem)`, text `clamp(0.65rem,1.7dvh,0.95rem)`. Bottom block: `clamp(0.7rem,1.7dvh,0.95rem)`.

When changing sizes: verify across viewports (1280×800, 1440×900, 1280×600, mobile 390×844) with **both dropdowns open**, checking no scrollbar appears. Extreme-landscape and ~600px-tall cases fall back to `overflow-y-auto` (documented, accepted). A quick-size change here has broken fit repeatedly — the gap between icons and text was tuned three times (settled: `0.7em`).
