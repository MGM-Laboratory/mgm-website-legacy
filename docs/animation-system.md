# Animation System (GSAP)

All site animation is **GSAP 3.15.0** (+ ScrollTrigger, ScrollSmoother). "Heavy animations everywhere" is an explicit design goal — but every animation must degrade gracefully under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Setup & conventions

- Plugins registered in `scroll-reveal.ts` (ScrollTrigger) and `smooth-scroll.tsx` (ScrollSmoother).
- **Scroll reveal**: `fadeUpOnScroll(root, selector, {start: "top 85%", stagger, y: 24})` — one timeline with a **timeline-level** ScrollTrigger, `once: true`. Under reduced motion it synchronously `gsap.set(targets, {opacity: 1, y: 0})` and returns null (no animation, therefore no race with hover timelines).
- **Smooth scrolling**: `<SmoothScroll>` in the root layout wraps everything; NOT created under reduced motion.
- **Reduced motion**: components check `matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)")`. The pattern is `const d = reduced ? 0 : 1;` and multiplying durations by `d` — timelines still run (content must stay reachable) but collapse to instant swaps. Decorative loops (idle breathing, social wiggle) are skipped entirely under reduced motion.
- **Hydration-safe clock** (`"--:--"` server-side, real time in effect) is the pattern for any time-dependent UI.
- **React 19**: refs pass as props (`ref={ref}`) on function components — no `forwardRef`.

## Gotchas (each of these has already cost real debugging time)

### 1. Never let a CSS class set transform on an element GSAP animates

GSAP **stacks onto** a pre-existing CSS-class transform instead of replacing it (observed twice: `translate-y-full` made a `yPercent` tween a no-op; a static `[transform:translateX(100%)]` class compounded with GSAP's `xPercent` to a 200% offset — computed style was literally `translate(100%,0%) translate(460px,0px)`). Tailwind v4's `translate-x-full` sets the separate CSS `translate` property — same failure mode.

**Rule:** GSAP must be the _only_ thing touching `transform`/`translate`/`rotate`/`scale` on an element, from first paint on (explicit `gsap.set()` in a mount effect). For pre-hydration "hidden" defaults use **opacity/visibility only** (`invisible opacity-0` — GSAP's `autoAlpha` cleanly overrides them).

### 2. `.fromTo()` renders its "from" state at creation (`immediateRender: true` default)

Even inside a `paused: true` timeline, creating a `.fromTo()` immediately applies the "from" values. Under reduced motion all durations collapse to 0, so "from" and "to" are the same instant — every card snapped to its hovered state **on mount, before any hover**. Fix: `immediateRender: !reduced` on such tweens. (`immediateRender` cannot be part of `defaults` — it's per-tween. Also note: `defaults: {immediateRender: false}` does not work reliably across GSAP versions; set it explicitly per tween.)

### 3. Hover-vs-entrance races: use `.fromTo()` baselines, not `.to()`

When a hover timeline and a scroll entrance (or idle loop) animate the **same property of the same element**, a plain `.to()` adopts "current value" as its implicit start. Hovering mid-entrance lets `overwrite: "auto"` kill the entrance at a partial value, and reversing the hover timeline returns to that **stuck half-finished value forever** — the famous Core Competencies bug (cards stuck lower than the others, sometimes `opacity: 0`).

**Fix pattern** (see `core-competencies.tsx`, heavily commented): build the hover timeline with `.fromTo()` specifying the true rest baseline (`{y: 0, opacity: 1}`, `{scale: 1}`), `immediateRender: !reduced`. Reduced motion doesn't need the protection (its entrance is a synchronous `gsap.set`, already resolved before any hover).

### 4. ScrollTrigger: use timeline-level triggers, not tween-level

GSAP 3.15.0 throws inside ScrollTrigger's internal refresh when a **tween-level** `scrollTrigger` is created after ≥4 other ScrollTriggers exist on a page that loaded already scrolled down (e.g. reload mid-page). `fadeUpOnScroll` deliberately builds a timeline with a timeline-level trigger (`gsap.timeline({ scrollTrigger: {...} })`). Don't regress to `gsap.fromTo(el, {...}, { scrollTrigger })` on this codebase.

### 5. SSR flash prevention (server HTML has no JS)

Anything hidden only by a mount-effect `gsap.set()` flashes visible on first paint / reload. Give closed-state defaults via static classes (opacity/visibility only — gotcha #1), and let the mount effect position the rest. Verified with a `javaScriptEnabled: false` Playwright context: server HTML must show nothing of the closed panel.

### 6. Panels inside collapsed clips

A panel mounted inside a `height: 0` accordion clip can't establish its starting transform value — `gsap.to(panel, {yPercent: 0})` may no-op. Set the start explicitly with `gsap.set(panel, {yPercent: 100})` on mount (see `work-bento.tsx`).

### 7. Stacking contexts & z-index under transforms

GSAP's transform creates its own stacking context, so a child with a stray `z-10` can paint over a sibling overlay that animates in later (observed: front title painting over the Our Work reveal panel — fixed by removing the z-10). Keep z-index flat inside animated subtrees.
